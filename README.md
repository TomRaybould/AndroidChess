A group project by Tom Raybould & Mike Tomkowich for Rutgers CS 213, made in Android Studio.

Screen shots of this app can be seen in the ScreenShots folder of the project.

- This project is a chess app for andriod phones, where two people can play against each other on one phone. 

- The players have the option to undo the last move that was played, or to use the "AI" button which makes a random legal move for that player.

- You must draw, resign, checkmate, or stalemate to record a game. 

- Recorded games are stored under the name the user inputs.

- Recorded games can then be replayed move for move by selecting the game in the main menu and hitting "replay game".

- Date sort displays all the games from newest to oldest and name sort, sorts them all alphabetically.
